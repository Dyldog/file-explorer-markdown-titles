# Obsidian File Explorer Notes Count

- This plugin helps you to see the number of notes you have under all available folders within your file explorer. 

- Collapsed Folders will show the total number of notes including all sub-folders.

- Uncollapsed folders won't have the number of notes in case they have sub-folders.
