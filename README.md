# Obsidian File Explorer Notes Count

## Brief Explanation

- This plugin helps you to see the number of notes you have under all available folders within your file explorer. 

- Counts will include total number of all markdown notes under a folder and its sub-folders.

- By default, expanded folders won't have the number of notes in case they have sub-folders.

## Settings

- You can turn on the option for viewing the counts for all folders including the expanded folders. Otherwise, expanded folders won't have the number unless the expanded folder does not include any sub-folder.
